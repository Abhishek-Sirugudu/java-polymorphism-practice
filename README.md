# Java Polymorphism Practice

This repository demonstrates two types of polymorphism in Java:
1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

# Method Overloading
- Same method name with different parameters
- Demonstrated in `Calculator.java` with multiple `add()` methods

# Method Overriding
- Child class redefines parent class method
- Demonstrated in `Cat.java` overriding `makeSound()` from `Animal.java`
